## Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

To complete The Course Project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/), we have to use several data files from 

["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) to perform an analysis on the data set, and create a tidy data set as output.

**Before running the R script you need to get Source Data Files:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file in your Working directory. (Run getwd() to get this path if you don't know).

**Run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).** [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html) is required, but installation is included in the script if necessary.

**Output: A tidy data set, [tidy_dataset.csv](tidy_dataset.csv).**

More information in the [Code Book](CodeBook.md).
